# Todo

- Adjust verbosity to show less output on screen by default
- Add a `--log-level` option to the CLI to control verbosity
- Add more plots (time series, boxplots, more?)
  - When doing that, add another example with more data
- Add CONTRIBUTING instructions for development
- Prepare a full example (config and data)
- Make `picarrito` installable using `pip`
- Add notes on units of flux estimates
- Add notes on dimensions of flux estimates (it's all volumetric)
- Add friendly error message when trying to import data with columns/dtypes mismatch between existing database and config file
- Allow nullable ints, uints, bools?
